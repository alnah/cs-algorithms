Remember:
- Log(16, base 2) means "How many times 2 need to be multiplied by itself to react 16?"

From slow to fast:
- logarithmic: log(n, b)
- linear: (a * n) + b
- quadratic: n ** n
- factorial: !n

Big-O complexity:
- Excellent:
    * hashmap lookup: O(1)
    
- Great:
    * binary search in sorted array: 0(log(n))

- Fair:
    * iteration: O(n)
    * sequence of iterations: 0(n*m) ðŸ’ª best on smallest sets
    * merge sort: O(n*log(n)) ðŸ’ª best on largest sets

- Horrible:
    * nested iterations: 0(n**2)
    * recursive branching: 0(2**n)
    
- Hell:
    * generating all permutations: O(n!)

Rules of Thumbs:
- use hashing whenever possible
- sort once, then search
- avoid nested loops, unless dealing with small inputs
- recursion is dangerous unless you can:
    * early stop
    * eliminate branch
    * memoize
- don't use educational purpose algorithms in reaf-life, but rely on the language implementation.

"""
    Python uses Timsort: a hybrid sorting algorithm optimized for real-world data.
    - It is a combination of MergeSort and InsertionSort.
    - It is stable, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
    - It adapts well to partially sorted data, achieving better-than-O(n log n) performance in some cases.
    - It performs MergeSort on large partitions and falls back to InsertionSort for small subarrays.
    - It requires additional memory for merging, unlike in-place sorting algorithms like IntroSort.

"""
    Go uses IntroSort: a hybrid sorting algorithm that optimizes performance.
     - It begins with QuickSort for fast average-case sorting.
     - It switches to HeapSort when recursion depth exceeds a level based on log2(input size) to avoid worst-case O(nÂ²).
     - It falls back to InsertionSort for small partitions, as it is efficient for small datasets.
     - It is not stable, meaning the relative order of equal elements is not preserved.
     - It is in-place, meaning it does not require extra memory for sorting, unlike Timsort.
